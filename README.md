ETHAZI Project repository

Here you will find the source code of our project

Inside the rest-trial folder you will find our first tries, while we were following the tutorials and learning the basics, nothing important

Inside the rest-real folder is basically all the code of our project. There you will find three folders: asp, mongo and java
  
  Inside ASP is the whole source code of our ASP web aplication and a .png file with the class diagram
  
  Inside Mongo is the JSON file we used to create the books collection
  
  Inside Java is a folder with the whole source code of our Java REST service, and the class diagram of it, both on .svg and .dia formats
